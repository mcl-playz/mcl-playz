# Hello!
I'm **Jasper**, I got into coding when I was <ins>6</ins> and have been doing it since. I've learnt many languages such as: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Java, Batch, Skript, Python, Scratch, GDScript, Bauxite, React, and a bit of C#.
I'm wanting to create minecraft mods/plugins, discord bots, and games. I've been creating a discord bot for a friends business. It succeeded. If you would like to talk to me, you can message
me on discord: mcl_playz
